# geoprocessing
A framework for running Python geoprocessing scripts in a Docker container

When you run it in VSCode, select "Python: Geoprocessing" in the debugger
and it will execute the geoprocessing module.

You can run the demo flask app app.py too by selecting "Python: Flask"
but at this time, it does nothing useful.
